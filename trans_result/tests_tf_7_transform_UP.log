2022-05-19 15:45:19,542 - tensorflow - WARNING - Functional inputs must come from `tf.keras.Input` (thus holding past layer metadata), they cannot be the output of a previous non-Input layer. Here, a tensor specified as input to "functional_2" was not an Input tensor, it was generated by layer dense_1.
Note that input tensors are instantiated via `tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape)`.
The tensor that caused the issue was: dense_1/Relu:0
